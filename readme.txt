PLAYABLE MILO ELDRIDGE WITH GURUBANI KAUR (STORY ONLY)
======================================================

Apparently, I noticed that there is no radio command to spawn Milo Eldridge of Lifeline into Story mode but his model exists within the game's files. This mod is intended to add him to your Enclave along with Gurubani Kaur.

This mod adds Milo Eldridge from Lifeline to YOSE story mode. Take note that you can start using your radio commands after reaching the church and after the mission "Lay of the Land". Normally, when you use the radio command "Bonus Survivor", you only spawn Gurubani Kaur. With this mod, you also spawn Milo Eldridge and make him playable immediately. Upon using the radio command, they add the following to your homesite's supply locker:

- 4 Food, 4 Medicine, and 60 rounds of .45cal ammunition (Gurubani)
- 4 Ammo, 4 Fuel, and 15 pipe bombs (Milo)

To install, place the contents into your Steam directory of your State of Decay YOSE game. For example, "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\State of Decay YOSE\Game".

To uninstall, simply remove rtsevents.xml and rtsevents.win.bmd under libs/class3/rts/ directory.
